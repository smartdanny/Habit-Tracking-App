# Kitten - Habit Tracking Desktop Application
Kitten is a general habit-tracking application with a multitude of modularized tracking features including recording mouse movement, key presses, time spent on computer applications, and time spent on websites. Kitten's functionality was created to support and benefit gamers, teachers, parents, the typical Internet and computer user, and more.
## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you in obtaining an up-and-running copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
Kitten is being developed with Python 3.6.4 which can be downloaded by heading to the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and downloading the appropriate package for your local machine.

*Note: If given the option during the installation process, be sure to add the install directory in the PATH environment variable on your local machine. This allows you to run the Python interpreter in any development working directory.*

Next, you will need [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (Python Package Index), but luckily PIP comes packaged in all binary installers starting with Python 3.4.

*Note: For ease of use it is recommended that you also add the directory path that PIP lies in to the PATH environment variable on your local machine for ease of access.*

### Installation
Navigate to the directory that holds `pip.exe` (or if the directory path is included in your local machine's PATH environment variable, navigate anywhere) and install the following required modules:

`$ pip install PyQt5 pynput pandas matplotlib`

**We need to be sure to update the required Python modules to the install command above**
